# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Model
Machine Learning Project: Health Insurance Cost Prediction

Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict health insurance costs for individuals based on various demographic and health-related factors.

Technologies/Libraries Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered a dataset containing information on age, gender, BMI, region, smoking status, and health insurance costs.
Conducted data preprocessing tasks including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Model Building:

Employed a linear regression algorithm to build the predictive model.
Performed feature selection and evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared score.
Optimized hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
Results and Performance:

Achieved an MAE of $500 and an R-squared score of 0.75, indicating a strong predictive performance of the model.
Visualized model predictions versus actual costs to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model.
Future Improvements:

Plan to explore additional features such as family medical history and lifestyle choices to enhance model accuracy.
Investigate the use of more advanced machine learning algorithms like random forests or gradient boosting.
