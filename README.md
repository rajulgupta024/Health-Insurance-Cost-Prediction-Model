# Health-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Model
Project Title: Health Insurance Cost Prediction Model  

Description:

Welcome to the Health Insurance Cost Prediction Model project! This open-source project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates health insurance costs for individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and more. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights into potential healthcare expenses, empowering individuals and insurance providers to make informed decisions.

Key Features:

Data Exploration: Dive into the provided dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of features impacting health insurance costs.

Model Development: Utilize advanced machine learning algorithms, including regression and ensemble methods, to train and fine-tune predictive models.

Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Interactive Visualization: Visualize model predictions and insights using interactive plots and dashboards to facilitate understanding and interpretation.

Why Contribute?

Learning Opportunity: Gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation in the context of healthcare analytics.

Community Collaboration: Collaborate with a diverse community of data enthusiasts, researchers, and healthcare professionals to enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.

Social Impact: Contribute to improving healthcare accessibility and affordability by developing a tool that aids in estimating insurance costs accurately.
